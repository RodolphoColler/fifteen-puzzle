# Fifteen-puzzle

Digital version of the fifteen-puzle, a game that was very popular on nineteen century.

The puzzle is a board with randomized numbers and your goal is place the tiles in numerical order.

For me it is kinda amazing, when i first saw this game I start to questionate myself "How i can build this?" and it pursuit me for some days until I started to figure out some ways to do that.
